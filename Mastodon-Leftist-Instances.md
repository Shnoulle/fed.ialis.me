## Fediverse & Federalisme
### Left-wing Mastodon Instances and Building a community

***THIS IS A DRAFT BY JD***

Mastodon is the new open source alternative to Twitter and Facebook.  And with every new communications technology comes people who want to use it to build their own new communities of interest â€“ ours is Left politics.

Of course, we want everyone to join our Socialisme instance, but we understand other domains have their own appeal.

In the spirit of solidarity and coalition building we categorise the Mastodon Instances that have a Left (or Left leaning) political perspective and advocacy.


#### Political Parties

### Questions:
- Who gets listed here, exactly?

The above list does not mean Soc.ialis.me endorses the content or the members of these instances, nor the technical stability of Instances themselves.  We just like the domains and maybe we know some of the Admin people behind the scenes and think their Mastodon efforts for the revolution should be listed.

- How can my Instance be listed?

Email us and maybe we will add it. :-)
